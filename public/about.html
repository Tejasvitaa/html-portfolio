<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!! I am Tejasvitaa Singh, currently pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science from VIT Vellore, India.
I prefer to describe myself in three words whenever someone pops the question, "Tell me about yourself?":
Persistent, jovial and a little shy (maybe a good sense of humour? ah no who am i kidding)
ANYWAYS, Welcome and here, i'll be sharing with you, all my projects! Hop on.
